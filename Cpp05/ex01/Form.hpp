	operators like +, -, *, =, etc., as member functions of a class when
	the operation directly affects the state of the object. On the other
	hand, operators like << and >>, which are used for input and output
	operations and don't directly modify the object's state, are typically
	overloaded as free functions or friend functions to provide more
	flexibility and maintain a separation of concerns. */
