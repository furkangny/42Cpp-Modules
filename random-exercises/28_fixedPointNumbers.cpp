/* fixed-point numbers use a fixed number of bits for
the integer and fractional portions of the value.
In a fixed-point representation, a certain number of bits are
reserved for the integer part, and the remaining bits are
allocated for the fractional part.
The position of the binary point is predetermined and remains
fixed for all numbers in that representation. */
