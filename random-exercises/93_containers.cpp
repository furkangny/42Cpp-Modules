/* In C++, containers are data structures that
allow you to store and manage collections of objects.
These containers are part of the Standard Template
Library (STL) and provide various data structures,
each with its own characteristics and use cases.
Here are some of the most commonly used containers in C++:

std::vector: A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size.
std::list: A doubly-linked list
std::queue: A container that provides a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.
std::deque: A double-ended queue
std::set: A container that stores a sorted set of unique elements.
std::map: A container that stores key-value pairs, where keys are unique and sorted.
std::stack: A container that provides a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
std::array: A fixed-size array with a size that's determined at compile-time. */
