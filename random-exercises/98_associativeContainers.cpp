/* In C++, associative containers are a category of containers that
store elements as key-value pairs. They allow you to associate a
unique key with each value, making it efficient to look up and
manipulate data based on keys. The C++ Standard Library provides
several associative container classes, including std::map,
std::multimap, std::set, and std::multiset. */
